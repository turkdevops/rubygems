<!--

Thank you for contributing to the [rubygems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) repository, and specifically to the [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) gem.

Before opening your issue, make sure you have checked [our filing issues guide](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/doc/contributing/ISSUES.md).

Please fill in the following sections so we can process your issue as fast as possible:

-->

### Describe the problem as clearly as you can

<!-- Replace this with an explanation of the problem you are having. Be as much clear and precise as you can. -->

### Post steps to reproduce the problem

<!--

Fill this with a list of steps maintainers can follow to reproduce your issue. Note that while you are seeing this issue in your computer, maintainers might not see the same thing on theirs. There is a number of things that could influence this:

* How your ruby is setup (OS package, from source, using a version manager).
* How bundler & rubygems are configured.
* The version of each involved piece of software that you are using.
* ...

The more complete the steps to simulate your particular environment are, the easier it will be for maintainers to reproduce your issue on their machines.

Ideally, we recommend you to set up the list of steps as a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). A Dockerfile provides a neutral environment that should give the same results, no matter where it's run.
